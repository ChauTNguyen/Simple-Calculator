# Simple-Calculator

Simple calculator made in Python. </br>
For educational purposes only. </br></br>

Why I made this:
I wanted to make a super simple calculator to help me with daily calculations for certain classes where I do not need a advanced calculator (when I do need to do such things, I would just use my real calculator). I wanted something that's small, convenient (for me, since I type 110-150 WPM) enough to type in a simple but long calculation, and doesn't have too many unnecessary features, but just have enough to calculate some annoying things (ln for example). I also wanted to be able to at least see at least two of the numbers I typed in case if I make an error and want to delete something. On the Mac calculator, the numbers go through a stack and so you don't see the previous number after typing let's say, 5 + 2, the 5 will disappear from the screen and sometimes I forget what operand I typed lol.</br>

EDIT: A week or two later since I first began it, I managed to finish a decent version if it. The process of making the calculator was a lot of fun and taught me a lot about creating GUI's in general. A month(?) later, I started working on a Java Tic-Tac-Toe game, and later a music player. Choosing python for the calculator was great because if its ease of use (took me less than an hour to get used to Tkinter).</br>

Anyways, the calculator can do all of the basic features you would expect from a calculator, and supports operator priority. However, it lacks parenthesises. I'm not that great at parsing and handling strings (which is also why I had to copy the parsing code), so I do not know exactly how I would implement the full PEMDAS in as of now.
