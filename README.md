# Simple-Calculator

Simple calculator made in Python.
For educational purposes only.

I finally decided for my first personal project I would make a simple calculator. This calculator is kinda buggy,
but it works really well for me. I wanted to practice GUI development, and at first I was thinking of Java, but it looked
annoying to setup and so I decided to just use Python & Tkinter! It took me a couple hours to finish the basic version of it.

Why I made this:
I wanted to make a super simple calculator to help me with daily calculations for certain classes where I do not need a advanced calculator (when I do need to do such things, I would just use my real calculator). I wanted something that's small, convenient (for me, since I type 110-150 WPM) enough to type in a simple but long calculation, and doesn't have too many unnecessary features, but just have enough to calculate some annoying things (ln for example). I also wanted to be able to at least see at least two of the numbers I typed in case if I make an error and want to delete something. On the Mac calculator, the numbers go through a stack and so you don't see the previous number after typing let's say, 5 + 2, the 5 will disappear from the screen and sometimes I forget what operand I typed lol.

Instructions:
For the four main operands, you can type in binary expressions to quickly calculator things.
There MUST be at least one space between the operands and the operator because of the function I used.

_ represents spaces (for readability)
Examples of simple calculations:
5_+_2 -ENTER- </br>
5__+_2 -ENTER- </br>
5___+_2 -ENTER- </br>
5_+__2 -ENTER- </br>
6_+_4 -ENTER- + 10 -ENTER- * 23 -ENTER- -sqrt- </br>
1024 -logbase2- </br>
2048 -logbase2- </br>

To calculate a binary expression you can just type enter after typing it. While the 4 main operators append, the other functions (ln, log, etc) all apply only on a singular number, and will calculate the value instantly. This means that you cannot do complicated expressions such as 5^2 + 4^5. I also don't have a power to any exponent function yet since I couldn't figure out a way that's consistent with everything else.
